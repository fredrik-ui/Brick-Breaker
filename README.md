# Brick-Breaker
<br> This is a simpel game in Java. Brick breaker, you might know, is a game where a paddle bounces a ball towards bricks and when colliding removes it and gives a certain amount of points. This is not yet complete, work in progress!

Main file:<br>This file creates the window (as an instance), more can be added here later but for now it just a place to start from. **Only need to compile this file and run it to launch the game.**
